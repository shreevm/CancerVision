## Introduction

**CancerVision** is a deep learning-based system designed to improve early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. The project classifies tumor images into two categories: malignant or benign, helping healthcare professionals make accurate and timely decisions.

**Purpose**:  
- Enable early detection and intervention for breast cancer.  
- Enhance prediction accuracy using deep learning.  
- Support research in breast cancer diagnosis.
